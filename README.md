# node-express-service
I built a node-express web api  from the Docker Image building by A Dockerfile and deploy it inside Azure Container Registry. I build my custom OPEN API to read all Wab API available inside the service
To Test The WEB API : 
- clone the project in your local PC.
- move to the root directory of the project
- run npm install and npm start
- run docker-compose up
- to test web API, open navigator and search for URL http://localhost:3000/welcome ( in first )  and http://localhost:3000/greeting ( in second )
- to read the documentation of the Web API, open another window and search url for http://localhost:3002
- it'' run very well
